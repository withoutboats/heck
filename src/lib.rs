//! **heck** is a case conversion library.
//!
//! This library exists to provide case conversion between common cases like
//! CamelCase and snake_case. It is intended to be unicode aware, internally,
//! consistent, and reasonably well performing.
//!
//! ## Definition of a word boundary
//!
//! Word boundaries are defined as the "unicode words" defined in the
//! `unicode_segmentation` library, as well as within those words in this
//! manner:
//!
//! 1. All underscore characters are considered word boundaries.
//! 2. If an uppercase character is followed by lowercase letters, a word
//! boundary is considered to be just prior to that uppercase character.
//! 3. If multiple uppercase characters are consecutive, they are considered to
//! be within a single word, except that the last will be part of the next word
//! if it is followed by lowercase characters (see rule 2).
//!
//! That is, "HelloWorld" is segmented `Hello|World` whereas "XMLHttpRequest" is
//! segmented `XML|Http|Request`.
//!
//! Characters not within words (such as spaces, punctuations, and underscores)
//! are not included in the output string except as they are a part of the case
//! being converted to. Multiple adjacent word boundaries (such as a series of
//! underscores) are folded into one. ("hello__world" in snake case is therefore
//! "hello_world", not the exact same string). Leading or trailing word boundary
//! indicators are dropped, except insofar as CamelCase capitalizes the first
//! word.
//!
//! ### Cases contained in this library:
//!
//! 1. UpperCamelCase
//! 2. lowerCamelCase
//! 3. snake_case
//! 4. kebab-case
//! 5. SHOUTY_SNAKE_CASE
//! 6. Title Case
//! 7. SHOUTY-KEBAB-CASE
